# Tree-Graph-Search-Algorithms 🧠
This repository contains python Implementation of some popular tree/graph searching algorithms. New algorithms will be added very soon. The existing implementation may also be modified. For simplycity, I have constracted an adjacency matrix which is determined by the edges details. The adjacency matrix and their corresponding values create a convenient tree/graph.
